# Weather App

An example app using the ambient weather station I have in my backyard. I've created a RESTful API that polls the ambient servers and retreives the latest info there and puts it in a mongoDB and uses that to display data on this site. I'm using React and D3 on the front end as I'm most fmiliar with those frameworks. On the backend, I'm using node.js, express, nginx, mongoDB, and mongoose. 

I've started this in vanilla javascript, but have a typescript branch that I'll give more attention to once I have a few charts/components developed here. I'm also slowly porting this to Nextjs, but that'll be a ways down the road before it's the live one here.
